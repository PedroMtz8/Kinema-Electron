# Steps to create the desktop app

### Install dependencies

```
 npm install
```

### Run command builder

```
 npm run build-installer
```


This will create a dist folder with the .exe file installer inside

If this command gives you an error and doesn't generate the .exe file, 
try to execute the command using cmd as an administrator
